I am currently learning about the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  I hope to learn quite a bit.  I already have some experience with Node.js and Express.  Lets see how this goes.

Requirements:
  -node_modules:
  Express, Mongoose, Gravatar, BCryptJs, JWT, and Body-Parser.

How to use:
navigate to your terminal and run npm start.  That's it!
