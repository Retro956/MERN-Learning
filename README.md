I am currently learning about the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  I hope to learn quite a bit.  I already have some experience with Node.js and Express.  Lets see how this goes.

Requirements:
  -node_modules:
  Express, Mongoose, Gravatar, BCryptJs, JWT, and Body-Parser.

I am currently working on the backend.  Once this is finished, I plan to add a frontend to this using React.  
We will see how this goes.  Currently, all is going well and a lot of this makes a sense.  After finishing the profiles api, I should be able to start working on the frontend!
